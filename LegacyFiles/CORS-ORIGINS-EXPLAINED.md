# üåê CORS_ORIGINS Explained

## ‚ùì **What is CORS_ORIGINS?**

CORS_ORIGINS tells your backend which frontend URLs are allowed to make API calls. It's a security feature.

## ‚úÖ **For Render Deployment - Use This Value:**

```
Name: CORS_ORIGINS
Value: https://red-hill-054635e0f.1.azurestaticapps.net,https://gamesraffle.netlify.app
```

## üîç **Why This Value Works:**

### Part 1: `https://red-hill-054635e0f.1.azurestaticapps.net`
- **This is your CURRENT Azure frontend URL** 
- **Keeps your existing site working** during migration
- **Allows testing both platforms simultaneously**

### Part 2: `https://gamesraffle.netlify.app`  
- **Placeholder for your future Netlify URL**
- **You'll update this in Step 3** when you get your actual Netlify URL
- **Format will be: `https://[your-chosen-name].netlify.app`**

## üöÄ **Migration Strategy:**

**Step 2 (Render)**: Use the combined value above
- ‚úÖ Azure frontend can call Render backend
- ‚úÖ Future Netlify frontend will also work

**Step 3 (Netlify)**: Update CORS_ORIGINS with your real Netlify URL
- You'll replace `gamesraffle.netlify.app` with your actual URL
- Both Azure and Netlify frontends work during testing

## üîß **How to Update CORS Later:**

1. **Deploy Netlify** in Step 3
2. **Get your actual URL** (e.g., `https://amazing-app-123.netlify.app`)  
3. **Update CORS_ORIGINS** in Render dashboard to:
   ```
   https://red-hill-054635e0f.1.azurestaticapps.net,https://amazing-app-123.netlify.app
   ```

## ‚úÖ **For Now - Just Use the Value Above**

The CORS value I provided works perfectly for starting your Render deployment. You'll fine-tune it in Step 3!
