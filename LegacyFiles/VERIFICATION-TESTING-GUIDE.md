# 🎯 Verification Testing Guide - Final Migration Step

## Overview
Your GamesRaffle2 platform has been successfully migrated to completely free infrastructure! You've reached the verification screen, which means registration and authentication are working perfectly. This guide will help you complete the final testing steps.

## 📧 Development Verification Codes

Since we're in development mode and don't have real email/SMS infrastructure set up yet, use these test codes:

### Email Verification
- **Test Code:** `test123`
- Enter this code in the email verification field

### SMS Verification  
- **Test Code:** `123456`
- Enter this code in the SMS verification field

## 🔧 Required CORS Update on Render

To ensure proper frontend-backend communication, update your Render service configuration:

1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Select your backend service: `gamesraffle2-backend`
3. Click on "Environment" tab
4. Find or add environment variable: `CORS_ORIGINS`
5. Set value to: `https://68a1061ae6cf2400099f6e94--fastidious-syrniki-83ea1e.netlify.app`
6. Click "Save"
7. Wait for automatic redeploy (1-2 minutes)

## 🧪 Complete Testing Checklist

### Step 1: Update CORS (Required First)
- [ ] Update `CORS_ORIGINS` on Render dashboard
- [ ] Wait for redeploy completion

### Step 2: Test Verification Flow
- [ ] Go to your verification screen
