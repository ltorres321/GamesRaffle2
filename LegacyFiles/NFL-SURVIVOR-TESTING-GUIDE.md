# NFL Survivor Game Testing Guide

## üèà System Overview

The complete NFL Survivor game system is now implemented with:

- **Backend**: Express.js on Render with full survivor game engine
- **Frontend**: Next.js on Netlify with complete contest interfaces  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Supabase with survivor schema
- **Authentication**: JWT system working end-to-end
- **Cost**: $0/month (down from $103/month)

## üöÄ Ready for Testing

## üß™ Complete Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Load Historical Data
Load 2024 NFL season data with real game results for testing:

```bash

Create a survivor contest for testing:

```bash
POST {{RENDER_URL}}/api/survivor/games
Authorization: Bearer {{JWT_TOKEN}}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "gameName": "Test Survivor Pool 2024",
  "description": "Testing NFL Survivor mechanics with 2024 historical data",
  "entryFee": 0,
  "maxParticipants": 10,
  "startWeek": 1,
  "endWeek": 18,
  "requireTwoPicksFromWeek": 12,

}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Survivor game created successfully",

    "gameId": "uuid-game-id",
    "gameName": "Test Survivor Pool 2024",
    "status": "open",
    "inviteCode": "ABC123"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Join Game as Player
Join the created game:

```bash
POST {{RENDER_URL}}/api/survivor/games/{gameId}/join
Authorization: Bearer {{JWT_TOKEN}}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully joined survivor game",
  "data": {
    "gameId": "uuid-game-id",
    "playerId": "uuid-player-id",
    "status": "active"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Make Weekly Picks
Submit picks for each week:

```bash
POST {{RENDER_URL}}/api/survivor/games/{gameId}/picks
Authorization: Bearer {{JWT_TOKEN}}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "week": 1,
  "teamPicks": ["KC"]
}
```

**For Two-Pick Weeks (Week 12+):**
```json
{
  "week": 12,
  "teamPicks": ["KC", "BUF"]
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Picks submitted successfully",
  "data": {
    "week": 1,
    "picks": [
      {
        "teamAlias": "KC",
        "teamName": "Chiefs",
        "gameDate": "2024-09-05T20:20:00Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Process Weekly Results
Run batch processing for week results:

```bash
POST {{RENDER_URL}}/api/survivor/admin/process-week/1
Authorization: Bearer {{JWT_TOKEN}}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Week 1 processed successfully",
  "data": {
    "week": 1,
    "playersProcessed": 5,
    "playersEliminated": 2,
    "playersActive": 3
  }
}
```
