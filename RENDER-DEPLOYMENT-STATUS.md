The spinning icon means Render is:
1. **Installing dependencies** (npm install with compression, morgan, pg)
2. **Building your application**
3. **Starting the server**
4. **Health checking** the deployment

### **Expected Timeline:**
- **Free tier deployments**: 5-15 minutes (especially first time)
- **Your deployment**: Should complete within 10 minutes

## 🔍 **How to Monitor:**

1. **Watch the deployment logs**:
   - Click on the deployment entry (the spinning one)
   - View real-time build logs
   - Look for successful completion

2. **Success indicators**:
   - ✅ Spinning stops, shows "Live" status
   - ✅ Green checkmark appears
   - ✅ Your service URL becomes accessible

3. **If it fails**:
   - ❌ Red X will appear
   - ❌ "Deploy failed" message
   - 🔍 Check logs for specific errors

## 🎯 **Expected Success:**

Once complete, you should see:
- ✅ Service status: "Live"
- ✅ URL accessible: `https://gamesraffle2.onrender.com`
- ✅ Health check working: `/health` endpoint responds
- ✅ Database connected to Supabase automatically

## ⚠️ **Only Cancel If:**
- Deployment is stuck for >20 minutes

**Your deployment is progressing normally - just wait for it to finish!**
